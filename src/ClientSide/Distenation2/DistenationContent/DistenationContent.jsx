          1. American universities are second to none
        </h1>
        <p className="distenation2Para">
          When you think about universities in the US, Harvard, Stanford, Yale
          or MIT might come to mind. But these are only the tip of the iceberg,
          the crème de la crème. There are over 150 American universities and
          colleges that earn their place in the international rankings created
          by Times Higher Education, Top Universities, and others.For those
          interested in academic excellency, studying in the US should be at the
          top of the preference list. There’s something for everybody and you
          can enroll in any specialisation (or major) you can think of.

          2. Tuition fees for anyone’s budget
        </h1>
        <p className="distenation2Para">
          The higher education system in the US is notorious for high tuition
          fees and an even higher national student debt. Still, you’d make a
          mistake by thinking studying at an American university is always
          expensive.With a simple search on our portals, you’ll discover
          thousands of affordable courses, with annual tuition fees of 10,000
          USD or less. At the opposite end, you can find study programme at Ivy
          League universities that easily jump over 50,000 USD/year

        <h1 className="pb-[14px] distenation2Title">3. Academic flexibility</h1>
        <p className="distenation2Para">
          The flexibility students enjoy in America isn’t common in many other
          countries. In most cases, you don’t need to declare a major until the
          second year of study; keep in mind numerous undergraduate degrees
          (Bachelors) take 4 years to complete. What does it mean? It means you
          can try out various subjects and classes, see what interests you,
          learn what you don’t want to focus on, and only then make a decision.

          4. Unique student life and on-campus experiences
        </h1>
        <p className="distenation2Para">
          Although most Hollywood movies exaggerate things to make us laugh,
          don’t think there isn’t some truth behind the on-campus student life,
          which can be described anywhere from vibrant to wild or even
          over-the-top.If parties aren’t your thing, don’t worry. You can always
          take up sports, enroll in clubs (e.g. drama, music) or volunteer and
          support a cause that’s meaningful to you.

          While living and studying in the US, you’ll be presented with the
          opportunity to see some of the most impressive and beautiful natural
          and man-made attractions in the world.From the Yellowstone National
          Park to the Grand Canyon, from the Statue of Liberty to the Golden
